# Project Documentation

This is a brief documentation of the project:

I used vue3 with vite and the script setup features along with typescript.

You can find the typescript configuration I used in the tsconfig file and the eslint rules that keep the code clean and concise in the eslintrc file

I didn't use any external libraries so I can limit the bundle size.

This project is fully responsive and mobile friendly, down to 375px of screen width (IPhone SE)

## Files structure

I used a single view with many detached components such as filters, sidebar and menu to keep the code easy to read.
There is the services folder for api requests,
Helpers for functions with multiple usage,
Globals for states used in more than a component (I didnt want to use a state managment library to keep the project light with limited size),
and types to declare recieved api data types.

I hope everything is clear and if there is any question don't hesitate to send me an email fekinajd@gmail.com
